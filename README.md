# TUM_Thesis

This repository contains the code for my master's thesis titled "Recurrent Neural Networks for Prescriptive Analytics in Commodity Procurement" including:

* Deep Neural Networks (predictive and prescriptive) implemented in PyTorch
* Data-driven optimization models implemented in Gurobi
* Numerical studies based on Monte-Carlo simulation
* Visualisations of commodity price curves

The thesis is still ongoing.
